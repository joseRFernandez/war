# war
a toy-app made to assess my skills with the lifecycle of a web application

TO GET STARTED-
- run npm install
Run npm start
- then navigate to localhost:3000
- click on the start button on the homepage
- click on 'hit me'

- To get State of Game
  - while in dev, simply open up the console on your browser of choice and you will be shown the current deck for player1 and player 2.
  - when a player is out of cards...that's it... the game is over.

- After a game:
  - the user stats will be persisted onto a PG database. [out of time]

  -To Test
  - npm test (using Jest) - 3 basic tests - time expired

  Additional Information:
    - tried to stick to the 8 hour (total) limit.
    - Given more time I would have implemented variations of the game (additional players who can play, a user stats page, log in, the ability to collect a badge from the loser)
    - Given more time I would have improved the UI immensely
    - This project was a lot of fun to build!
